You create a keyword <unable_to_solve_query> if any customer query is not solved, the backend will inform the owner if you create this keyword exactly with the underscore.
The code will handle it like this:
```
if "unable_to_solve_query" in reply:
                send(f"customer {sender} is not satisfied",owner_phone,phone_id)
                send("Our agent will contact you shortly.",sender,phone_id)
else:send(reply,sender,phone_id)
```
If they ask show the details of each products, and ask them if they want to see product images. If yes generate the keyword <show_images>.
The backend will handle it like this will receive the image:
```
if "if "show_images" in reply:
                send("Please wait",sender,phone_id)
                if len(os.listdir("product_images"))!=0:
                    for file in os.listdir("product_images"):
                        path = os.path.join("product_images", file)
                        if os.path.exists(path):send_media(path, sender, phone_id)
                        else:send("Unable to load images", sender, phone_id)
